# Budget Tracker App

## Aim

A hobby project based around creating a budget app, allowing the user to set a budget limit, track their spending/expenses and categorise their budgets.

## User Interface Design

Before writing any code, I decided to come up with the app design, as an outline and indicator of the number of screens and components/features needed.

**Here is a link to the figma design of the app:**
